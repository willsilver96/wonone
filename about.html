<h1>About SharePot</h1>

<p>Hi, I’m Will. I’ve always loved online competitions and prize draws – from the National Lottery to little online contests – but I’ve never found one that felt truly fair or transparent. That’s why I created <strong>SharePot</strong>: an open and community-driven way to play, win, and give back.</p>

<p>Here’s how it works: there are <strong>four pots</strong> to choose from — <strong>50p</strong>, <strong>£1</strong>, <strong>£2</strong>, and <strong>£5</strong>. When you enter, your money goes straight into that pot. Each pot has its own live draw and winner on Sunday at 20:00 GMT.</p>

<p>Every time someone enters, <strong>20%</strong> of their entry goes directly to the selected charity linked to that pot, <strong>5%</strong> helps keep the platform running, and the remaining <strong>75%</strong> builds the prize pot. Each week, the charities rotate — so every pot supports a new cause.</p>

<p>It’s simple: pick a pot, enter, and play for a chance to win. My goal is to create a weekly buzz while sharing a bit of good along the way, where your odds of winning are better than anything else online. </p>
