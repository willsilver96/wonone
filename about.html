    <h1>About WON ONE</h1>

    <p>Hi, I’m Will. I’ve always loved online competitions and prize draws – from the National Lottery to little online contests – but I’ve never found one that felt truly fair or transparent. That’s why I created <strong>WON ONE</strong>: a simple, fun, and completely transparent way to play and win.</p>

    <p>Here’s how it works: you pay just <strong>11p</strong> to enter the prize draw. To qualify, you solve a question, equation, or puzzle – something small, fun, and brain-teasing. Complete it, and you’re in the draw.</p>

    <p>For example, if <strong>10,000 people</strong> enter at 11p each, the prize pot grows to <strong>£1,100</strong>. If everyone completes the challenge, that’s 10,000 people in the draw, giving a <strong>1 in 10,000 chance</strong> of winning £1,100. The winner is announced every Sunday night!</p>

    <p>For complete transparency, I don’t take any cut from the prize pot. My goal is to create a weekly buzz for just 11p, where your odds of winning are better than anything else online – no hidden tricks, no fine print, just pure fun. If you enjoy WON ONE, you’re welcome to make a small donation via PayPal to support me, and I’d be very grateful!</p>
